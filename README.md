Open3D Affordance Prototype
-------------------------------

This repository contains the first prototype for my affordance research project. The goal is to build a minimal pipeline that takes a 3D object, decomposes its geometry, and predicts simple affordances (possible interactions) such as sit, place, lean, and contain. 

---------------------------------------------- 

OVERVIEW

Game developers usually have to manually program every way players can interact with objects (e.g., sitting on a chair, placing items on a table). This project explores how AI systems can automatically map 3D geometry--> structural parts --> affordances, reducing manual work and opening the door to richer game interactions.

------------------------------------------

ðŸš€ Getting Started
Requirements

Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt


Main libraries:

Open3D
 â€“ mesh/point cloud processing

NumPy, SciPy â€“ math utilities

scikit-learn â€“ clustering support

trimesh â€“ mesh I/O helpers

Running the demo
python demos/run_one.py data/chair_01/mesh.glb


This will:

Load the chair mesh

Decompose it into sub-regions

Extract features

Classify affordances

Save outputs:

annotations/chair_01_pred.json (predicted labels)

out/chair_01_overlay.png (visualized regions)
