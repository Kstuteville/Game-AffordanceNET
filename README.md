#  Open3D Affordance Prototype
--------------------------------
This repository contains the **first prototype** for my affordance research project.  
The goal is to build a minimal pipeline that takes a 3D object, decomposes its geometry,  
and predicts simple affordances (possible interactions) such as **sit, place, lean, and contain**.

##  Overview
-------------------
Game developers usually have to manually program every way players can interact with objects  
(e.g., sitting on a chair, placing items on a table).  

This project explores how AI systems can automatically map:
